Scenario:
Design a simple, production-ready AWS architecture for a new web application consisting of a static front-end, a backend API, and a database.

High-Level Architecture:
1.Front-End Hosting:
oAmazon S3: Host static website files.
oAmazon CloudFront: Deliver content globally with low latency.
oAmazon Route 53: DNS routing to CloudFront distribution.
oAWS Certificate Manager: SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS.
2.Backend API:
oAmazon API Gateway: Expose RESTful API.
oAWS Lambda: Serverless backend logic.
oAmazon Cognito: User authentication.
3.Database Layer:
oAmazon RDS: Managed relational database (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
oDeployed in Private Subnets with Multi-AZ for high availability.
4.Networking and Security:
oAmazon VPC: Encompasses the entire architecture.
Public Subnets: NAT Gateways.
Private Subnets: RDS instances and Lambda functions.
oIAM Roles: Fine-grained access control.
oKMS: Encryption for data at rest.
5.CI/CD Pipeline:
oAWS CodePipeline: Orchestrates build and deployment.
oAWS CodeBuild: Builds front-end and tests backend.
oAWS CodeDeploy: Deploys front-end to S3 and updates Lambda functions.
6.Monitoring and Logging:
oCloudWatch: Logging, metrics, alarms.
oX-Ray: Request tracing.
oCloudTrail: Auditing API calls.
